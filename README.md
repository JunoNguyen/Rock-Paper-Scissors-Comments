# As a programmer..

* I want to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a computer that has randomized choices

* I want my game to keep track of my wins and losses

* I want to have a button that I can click in order to start the game

<br/>

# In order to achieve this..

* I need to implement a JavaScript function to start the game

* I need to create a JavaScript function to create the game

* I will need to utilize my current knowledge on JavaScript in order to create this game.       

    1) Conditional Statements

    2) JavaScript Functions

    3) Create/Append 

    4) Event Listeners

# In this code-along activity..

* I will ask the class what concepts I can use in order to create our game step by step

* We will start by psuedo-coding (making steps on how to achieve our final product)

* I will explain each concept and skill we use to create our game

* Ask a lot of questions; all questions are welcomed!
